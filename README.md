## Installation

### Database

The API server, Sails.js, supports many databases but we recommend MongoDB. Currently MySQL and
MongoDB are supported but we are in the process of moving completely to MongoDB.

Install MongoDB using your distribution's package manager; for example, in Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get install mongodb
```

### NPM

NPM is the package manager for Node.js and allows easy installation of the tools required by this
project. You can install NPM using your native distribution package manager; for example, in
Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get install npm
```

### Sails and Ember

Sails.js and Ember.js are Node.js frameworks and can be installed using npm:

```
npm install sails
npm install ember
```
