Develop marker map viewer

The database API codes (under the server folder) developed using sailsjs, and the web codes are in map_visualization folder. 
The idea is to convert the current web codes into a form of reusable APIs using emberjs (in the frontend folder).  

The entire framework is using seedsjs, which combines emberjs, sailsjs, semantic-UI together.
