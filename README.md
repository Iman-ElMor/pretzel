Develop marker map viewer

The database API codes (under the api folder) developed using sailsjs, and the web codes are in map_visualization folder. 
The idea is to convert the current web codes into a form of reusable APIs using emberjs (in the front_end folder).  

The entire framework is using seedsjs, which combines emberjs, sailsjs, semantic-UI together. 

To start the server, simply run “seeds s” following the instructions on http://docs.seedsjs.com/
