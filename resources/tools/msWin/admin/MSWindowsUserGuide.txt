
Introduction :

The application is accessed via a web browser, at this URL : http://localhost:4200/
A Node server, running as 'ember server', provides the web application frontend pages.
The frontend depends the backend server, also a Node server, running as 'node app.js',
and the backend depends on the database, mongoDb.

Starting :

The application processes are started in this order; each process depends on the preceeding processes :
 mongoDb
 backend server
 frontend server

These 3 are started by startAll.bat, which is accessed from the Windows Start Menu, under the application name 'Pretzel'.
Each process will run in a windows cmd window, which is a small text window (black with white text).
After they are started, the URL http://localhost:4200/ will operate.

startAll.bat uses these batch scripts to start the 3 processes :
startDb.bat           startBackend.bat      startEmber.bat
They can be accessed in the folder C:\data\admin
and used to restart individual processes after shutting them down.

Trouble-Shooting

To check if the backend server is running, open this URL in the web browser : http://localhost:1776/geneticmaps
This should return a list of the names of all the genetic maps which are in the database.
Hence this also confirms that the database is running.

To check if the database is running : from the Start Menu : dbStatus
Expected output  :
MongoDB shell version v3.4.6
connecting to: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017
MongoDB server version: 3.4.6
[ "geneticmaps" ]

Waiting for  8 seconds, press a key to continue ...

The window will close once the timeout is complete.


Shutting Down

The processes will shutdown OK when the computer is shut down.
It is possible to shut them down by closing the cmd windows in which they are running - there is an X at the top right-hand corner of each window.
These windows can be located from the ribbon listing current windows at the bottom of the screen.

Because of the dependencies between these processes, if you shutdown and restart the database then the backend server may need to be restarted,
and if you shutdown and restart the frontend server, a refresh (^R) may be required in the web browser tab.


Loading additional data :

With the windows explorer, navigate to this folder : C:\data\data\json\in
There is a script in the start menu which opens this folder : openJsonIn.bat

Place .json files in this folder, then run the script loadJsonFromDir.bat, in the start menu, which will read .json files from this folder,
then move them into this adjacent folder : C:\data\data\json\done\

This variation will load any .json files, then wait 30sec and repeat : loadJsonFromDirRepeat
It can be shutdown using the X at the top right-hand of the windows batch script window.
